"""HTTPS trust fixes for machines running TLS-inspecting software.

Why this module exists
----------------------
Two things break outbound HTTPS (OpenAI, Anthropic, any LLM or cloud API) on a
machine whose traffic is intercepted and re-signed — antivirus with "HTTPS
scanning", or a corporate proxy:

1. **``ssl.VERIFY_X509_STRICT``** is on by default from Python 3.12.  It rejects
   CA certificates whose Basic Constraints extension is missing or not marked
   critical, which is exactly what SSL-inspection roots tend to look like.  The
   handshake fails with::

       SSLCertVerificationError: certificate verify failed:
       Basic Constraints of CA cert not marked critical

2. **httpx passes ``cafile=certifi.where()``**, so only certifi's ~118 roots are
   loaded and any locally-installed CA — including the inspection root sitting
   in the Windows certificate store — is invisible::

       SSLCertVerificationError: unable to get local issuer certificate

Either way the OpenAI client reports the generic
``APIConnectionError: Connection error.``, which says nothing about certificates
and sends you looking for a network or API-key problem instead.

:func:`patch_ssl_context` clears the strict flag and additionally loads the OS
certificate store, so certifi's roots are supplemented rather than replaced.

Who calls this
--------------
Anything that makes outbound HTTPS calls and is NOT started through the backend:

* ``main.py`` (the FastAPI app) — on import
* ``langflow_components/flexible_graphrag/_fg_shared.py`` — for flow mode
* ``examples/`` scripts — they deliberately do not import the backend's main.py

The failure mode without it is confusing precisely because it is *partial*: the
app works (it patched on startup) while a standalone script against the same
API on the same machine fails, so it looks like the script is at fault.

Idempotent — calling it more than once is harmless.
